# NodeSweeper

NodeSweeper is a JavaScript conversion of PiSweeper by eye1der. See (the PiSweeper Github repository)[https://github.com/eye1der/PiSweeper].

Just double-click on `index.html` to open the game in your browser.


I converted the code with (CodeConvert)[https://app.codeconvert.ai/code-converter?inputLang=Python&outputLang=JavaScript] and then used (Cursor)[https://www.cursor.com/] to generate the index.html file for me. It took about ten minutes.

Of course I should have checked for bugs, but you can do that and report them here.
